NancyHacker is based on Logxen's ATTinyX4 breakout and is designed to allow easy reconfiguration of a NancyDriver.

Basic Operation:

1) Plug a NancyDriver into the NancyHacker and use a MicroUSB cable to supply power to the NancyHacker.

2) The LED on the NancyHacker will flash to read out the set current on the driver board in amps. First it will count out slow flashes (1 second on, 1 second off) representing the integer then short flashes (0.5 second on, 0.5 second off) representing the tenths. So, a brand new NancyDriver should arrive set to 1.2A and so should read one long flash followed by two short flashes and a pause.

3) The UP and DOWN buttons can be used to adjust the set current by tenths. The NancyHacker will then read out the new setting over the LED. That's all there is to it. :)
